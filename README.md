# TDoA - Time difference of arrival

## Inputs:

1. wav files with GNSS timestamps from KiwiSDRs which are generated by [kiwiclient](https://github.com/jks-prv/kiwiclient/tree/jks-v0.1)
2. positions of the used KiwiSDRs. This information is stored in the directory `gnss_pos` and put there by `kiwirecorder.py`

## Prerequisites
* This code should work on linux and on OSX
* Install octave + signal and mapping packages: in octave: `pkg install -forge signal` `pkg install -forge mapping`
* Install gnuplot: version 5.2 does work, earlier versions are not tested and may not work

## Download / Installation
* `git clone --recursive  https://github.com/hcab14/TDoA.git`
* For now everything is contained in the git repository, i.e., nothing is installed in /usr etc.

## Running the example octave script
* in octave: `[tdoa,input]=proc_tdoa_DCF77;`
* this should produce two files in the `png` subdirectory
